You can find data that can be used to convert hero and ability IDs and other information provided by the API from the [dotaconstants](https://github.com/odota/dotaconstants) repository.  **Beginning 2018-04-22, the OpenDota API is limited to 50,000 free calls per month and 60 requests/minute** We offer a Premium Tier with unlimited API calls and higher rate limits. Check out the [API page](https://www.opendota.com/api-keys) to learn more.
